## Laboratory work on algorithms and data structures

![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Arihina/HashTable)

The topic of the laboratory work is Hash Tables for storage a string.    
Was implemented:
- Hash Table with Linked list;
- Hash Table with Red - Black tree;

File **main.cpp** contains the entry point to the program.   
File **Tree.h** contains the class "RBTree" with methods to working with Red - Black tree. 
File **List.h** contains the class "LinkedList" with methods to working with single linked list.   
File **HashTable.h** contains the class "HashTable" with methods to working with HashTable based on single linked list.   
File **RBHashTable.h** contains the class "RBHashTable" with methods to working with HashTable based on Red - Black tree.
